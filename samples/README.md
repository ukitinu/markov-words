# Sample dictionaries

Some pre-built 'plug-and-play' dictionaries.

## Dunmer
**dunmer-family**, **dunmer-female** and **dunmer-male** were built out of the data from 
[the UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names) (Morrowind only so far) ([dunmer-input.txt](./dunmer-input.txt) 
contains the data used), with multiplicity kept when reading the names.  
Most results they produce are not very accurate with the default configuration, but they become acceptable if the *depth*
option is set to 3.
