# Sample dictionaries

Some pre-built 'plug-and-play' dictionaries.

## Dunmer names
**dunmer-family**, **dunmer-female** and **dunmer-male** were built out of the data from 
[the UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names) (the input files are also provided).  

## English town names
The input file was created out of [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_England). I also
tried to use *gram.max_length=5*. The result is 86MB of data generated by a single input of 12KB. As expected, with
high depth, the dictionary generates some very believable results.
